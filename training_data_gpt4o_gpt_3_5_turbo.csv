0,gpt-4o,Can you explain what a lambda function is?,"Certainly! A lambda function is a small, anonymous function defined with the `lambda` keyword in programming languages like Python. It's called ""anonymous"" because it is not given a name, unlike a regular function defined with the `def` keyword.

In Python, a lambda function can have any number of input parameters, but it can only contain a single expression. The syntax for a lambda function is:

```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

Here's a breakdown:
- `lambda` is the keyword used to define the lambda function.
- `arguments` are the parameters that the function takes.
- `expression` is a single expression executed by the function, and its result is returned.

### Example in Python

3,gpt-4o,Explain the difference between machine learning and deep learning in simple terms.,"Sure! 

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of artificial intelligence where computers use algorithms and statistical models to perform specific tasks without using explicit instructions. Instead, they rely on patterns and inference derived from data. Think of it as teaching a computer to learn from experience. For example, you might train a machine learning model to recognize spam emails by showing it lots of examples of both spam and non-spam emails.

**Deep Learning (DL)** is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence ""deep""). These neural networks are designed to mimic the way the human brain processes information. Deep learning is especially good at recognizing patterns in large amounts of unstructured data, such as images, audio, and text. For"
