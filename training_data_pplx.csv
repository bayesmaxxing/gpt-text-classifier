3,llama-3-sonar-small-32k-chat,Explain the difference between machine learning and deep learning in simple terms.,"Machine learning and deep learning are both types of artificial intelligence (AI) that enable computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. The main difference between the two is the complexity and depth of the algorithms used.

**Machine Learning:**

Machine learning is a type of AI that uses algorithms to analyze data and make predictions or decisions. These algorithms are designed to recognize patterns in the data and make predictions based on those patterns. Machine learning models can be trained on a dataset and then used to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Think of machine learning like a simple calculator. You feed it some numbers, and it can perform basic calculations like addition and subtraction. But it's limited to what it's been programmed to do.
